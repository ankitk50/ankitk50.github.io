The following article presents a contrast between analog and digital systems through the glued through the lenses of signal theory.

## History: An Analog road to the Digital World

Our world is inherently analog. All the naturally occurring information is in form of analog signal or waves. The sound waves carrying generated by our voice box as we speak or the optical signals perceived by our eyes, carry information in a continuous fabric of time and space, hence are analog. The nature of analog signals inspired early various techniques for recording and transmission of the information.

The magnetic tape recorders or vinyl records(shown below) were some analog methods used for data recording. Similarly, early AM and FM systems were purely analog. Early telephone system, which was designed primarily to transmit the human voice, translated sound waves into analogue signals for transmission, which are reconverted into sound waves at the receiving handset.

The process of recording an analog signal may cause a signification loss of information. The loss continues as we create more copies from original existing recordings. For e.g the quality of originally recorded vinyl would me much higher than one copied.

Another problem with an analog signal is that it is prone to electronic noise and distortion introduced by communication channels and signal processing operations, which can progressively degrade the signal. In contrast, although converting an analog signal to digital form introduces a low-level noise quantization noise (discussed later) into the signal. However, once in digital form, the signal can be processed or transmitted without introducing significant additional noise or distortion. In addition, digital systems allow degradation detection and correction, not available in analog systems. 

These benefits of a digital signal over analog motivated the humanity to embark on a voyage to a much promising world of digitization.

## The Digital Shift

The first step of establishing a digital regime is to invent a device that can convert a given analog signal to a digital signal. At the heart of this transition are devices known as Analog to Digital (A/D) converters.

An A/D converter converts a continuous time, continuous-amplitude analog signal (for e.g. a voice signal entering a microphone or light entering a camera) to discrete time, discrete-amplitude digital signal. This conversion involves sampling and quantization of the signal.

## Sampling 
Sampling is the process of handpicking values out of continuous range of values. This is done at regular intervals by multiplying the entire signal with a train of impulses. 	

 $$ x[n]_{sampled} = x(t)_{analog} \times \sum_{\tau=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-\tau)$$

Further if we see this operation in frequency domain, we have:

$$
\begin{align*}
  & y[n]_{sampled} = x(t)_{analog} \times \sum_{\tau=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-\tau)\\
  & Y(f)_{sampled} = X(f)_{analog} \ast \sum_{\tau=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-\tau)\\\\
  & x(t)=\delta(t) \\
\end{align*}
$$ 


## Quantization

After sampling each sample value is replaced by a binary number.
