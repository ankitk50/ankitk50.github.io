## History

Baron Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768−1830) was a french mathematician, known for his contributions in the field of heat transfer and vibration. He also helped develop many mathematical tools with profound application in today's world. He pointed out the fact that every periodic function can be made using a combination of sines and cosines. This idea of representaion of signals as superposition of basic waves is known as **Fourier series** and has led to a development of a new branch of mathematics known as the [harmonic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis).

## Definition

So, Fourier series of a periodic function $$\phi(x)$$ with period T is defined as:

$$
\begin{align*}
  & \phi(x) = a_0+ \sum_{i=1}^\infty a_ncos(nx) + \sum_{i=1}^\infty b_nsin(nx) \\
 where,\\
  &  a_0= \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T\phi(x)dx; \\
  & a_n = \frac{2}{T}\int_0^T\phi(x)cos(nx) dx; \\
  & b_n = \frac{2}{T}\int_0^T\phi(x)sin(nx) dx; \\
\end{align*}
$$

But, the question is whether, fouries series can be used to systhesis all types of functions? Can a set of continous functions (e.g. sine, cosine) can give rise to a non-continous function (e.g. square wave) ?

Here we'll try to validate fourier series by implemeting it by using python:


```python
from scipy import signal
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.pyplot import figure
import numpy as np

def plot_square_wave(): #plot a square wave
    t= np.arange(0,100,1) #x-axis range
    plt.plot(t, 1*signal.square(.02 * np.pi  * t))

#sythesis a square wave using fourier series
def fourier_series(func,N): 
    x= np.arange(0,10,.1)
    series=0 
    resolution=0.2
    if func=='square':
        plot_square_wave()
        for n in range(1,N):
            harmonic=((4/n*np.pi)*np.sin(resolution*(2*n-1)*np.pi*x)/N) 
            series+=harmonic #synthesis equation
    return series/N   

array=fourier_series('square', 10) #plotting the function
plt.plot(array)
```
Here's a animated version showing different functions being added up to get a close approximation to the square function.

</figure>

Here, we notice that the approximation overshoots the desired value at the edges of the square wave. This peculiar behaviour of fourier series is known as the [Gibbs phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_phenomenon). Informally, the Gibbs phenomenon reflects the difficulty inherent in approximating a discontinuous function by a finite series of continuous sine and cosine waves.
